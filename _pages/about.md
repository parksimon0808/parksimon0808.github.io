I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Princeton University expected to graduate with a concentration in Mathematics and a certificate in Applications of Computing and in Statistics and Machine Learning.

I am interested in mathematically understanding machine learning models. Some topics of my interests include: machine learning theory, deep learning theory, optimization, and natural language processing.

I recently helped Professors Sanjeev Arora and Danqi Chen write the [course notes](https://princeton-introml.github.io) on the COS 324 - Introduction to Machine Learning course.
