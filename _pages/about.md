I am a first-year masters student in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Princeton University. I am interested in mathematically understanding machine learning models, with an emphasis on large language models.

Last year, I helped Professors Sanjeev Arora and Danqi Chen write the [course notes](https://princeton-introml.github.io) on the COS 324 - Introduction to Machine Learning course.
