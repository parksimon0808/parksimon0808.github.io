title: Infinite-Width 1-Layer ReLU Networks with L2 Regularization on 2D Data
date: 2023-05-01
description: Given a dataset of two-dimensional input and one-dimensional output, investigated the set of 1-layer ReLU networks that interpolate the dataset and, among such interpolants, minimize the L2 norm of the weights. Considered datasets where the points either form the vertices of a regular polygon, or are symmetric with respect to a line.
