title: Free-Order Matroid Secretary Problem
date: 2022-01-25
description: Proposed a variation to an algorithm with a competitive ratio of 4; For uniform matroids, proved that the variation has a constant competitive ratio; conjectured that the ratio converges to *e* if the size of the matroid tends to infinity; For general matroids, empirically observed that the algorithm is likely to have a competitive ratio close to *e*
